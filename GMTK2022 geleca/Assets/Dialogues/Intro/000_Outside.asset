  - 
  - Great, another abandoned mansion. My client bought this old casino and nobody
    wants to get near it to work on repairs because of the *noises*.
  - "I hope this time it\u2019s a real ghost and not some weird teens roleplaying
    in private property. \r"
  - "My name is Dice T and I unhaunt houses, buildings, anything abandoned, that\u2019s
    my job and I hope I can finish this fast. Nobody deserves to negotiate with ghosts
    on a Friday night\u2026"
